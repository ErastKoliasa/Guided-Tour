The application was created using HTML, CSS, and JS. Additionally, I used bootstrap libraries for the client side and express for the server side.

The site is adaptive for different mobile devices. 
I used the mobile first design methodology when styling the site.
Carousels and accordion are made using the "bootstrap" library.

Created my own server that stores the data sent from the form in the contact.txt file.
To start the server, run the command "node server.js" in the terminal.
